# Desks Duels

## Overview
Welcome to **Desks Duels**! This Telegram WebApp is designed to let you compete for seats in your classroom by engaging in exciting challenges and duels. The main objective is to claim a seat before anyone else and defend it when challenged. Duels take place between the seat occupant (the first player) and a challenger (the second player), and the outcome is decided through a coin flip mini-game. The winner claims or retains the seat, while the loser must find another seat to occupy or challenge.

## Current Status
At this stage, **Desks Duels** focuses on establishing core functionalities and ensuring that the essential features work reliably. We are currently prioritizing functionality and seamless gameplay over design and interface styling.

## Future Improvements
In upcoming releases, we plan to enhance the user interface and experience by refining our design approach and possibly integrating more robust component libraries. Expect:
- More polished visuals and styling.
- Additional mini-games for duels.
- Expanded administrative tools and user management features.
